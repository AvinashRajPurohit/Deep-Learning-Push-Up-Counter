# Deep Learning Exercise Repetitions Counter

**Disclaimer:** This project was developed to integrate with an Android application during a 24 hours hackathon. One of the key elements was to keep the model small, capable of performing well on phones and easy to train with data manually gathered during those 24 hours. Therefore, this a simplistic approach to the problem of counting push ups, pull ups and squats. 


## Goal

## Workflow 

### Dataset construction 

### Model training 

### Counting repetitions

### Evaluation on a test video
